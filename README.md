# CS345-Final_CalculatorProject

Short description: A small calculator application. The calculator is intended to minimize the number of buttons, while also incorporating gestures for various functions, such as:
•	Equals: swipe up
•	Add: swipe right
•	Subtract swipe left
•	Clear: swipe down
There will also be a “history” display option that allows the user to view previously entered calculations, as usually seen with standard graphing calculators.
